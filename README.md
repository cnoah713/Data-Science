Data Science Projects
This is a project using data from SpaceX launches from start to finish which follows the IBM Data Science course from Coursera.
 The purpose of this course was to learn data wrangling, web scraping, visual exploratory data analysis with seaborn and matplotlib, SQL database management using IBM DB2, project management and structuring using Watson Studio, dashboard production using plotly DASH, and machine learning fundamentals with both categorical and continuous data types.
 Thank you for reviewing my project!
